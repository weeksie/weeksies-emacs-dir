!What's left in spirit/user?

You use the emacs modes to write with and the LaTeX classes to print.
What else is in there?

!Headers

The headers in the user directory are used to make LaTeX work with
ruby2shoes.  You are welcome to modify them all you want in order to get
the print quality you need.

Pay attention to this part in the movie and TV headers:
<pre>
 \setlength{\dialogindent}{1in}
 \setlength{\parenoffset}{.5in}
 %%
 %% You can tweak length here by changing dialogLength (3 - 4.5)
 %%
 \setlength{\dialogLength}{3in}
 \setlength{\parenLength}{3in}
 \setlength{\speakeroffset}{1.2in}
</pre>
You can fiddle with these numbers and modify the page count, scrunching
big scripts or sretching little ones.  I know for a fact that you can convert
your old professional script-software scripts to ruby2shoes and then match
the page count exactly by twiddling these.

!Scripts

These are Python scripts for doing this or that.  Here's the straight
poop, which may be an oxymoron:

TalentAgencyList.py
|
Open a terminal, connect to the internet, and type \
"python TalentAgencyList.py"
\This will go out to California and grab a list of all the Talent Agencies
registered by the state out there.
|

fc2sp.py
|
First write a book using ruby2shoes.  Then open a terminal in the book's
directory and enter:
\"python fc2sp.py your_book.fc"
\And it will create an sp screenplay file from the book, ready to be edited down
to 15,000 words.  Try removing all but the dialogue for starters.
|

tex2sp.py
|
If you take a LaTeX hollywood document and type:
\"python tex2sp.py script.tex"
\this script will give you a ruby2shoes sp file of the script.
|

tex2fc.py
|
This does the same thing for LaTeX book documents.
\"python tex2fc.py book.tex"
gives you an fc file of the book.
