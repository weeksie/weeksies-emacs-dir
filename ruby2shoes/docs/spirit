!Spirit is Magic

I got so sick of doing the same things to print or save or upload my
writing.  So I wrote Spirit.  It does all the printing and converting
and archiving and FTPing.  And it does it effortlessly in the console.

Here's what you get if you type "Spirit" at the command-line:
<pre>

Spirit
  Archive
    Spirit -az name = zip numbered archive of *name*
    Spirit -au name n = unzip name.n.zip in pwd
    Spirit -ap name = put archive of *name* to remote
    Spirit -ag name = get archive of *name* from remote
  Print
    Spirit -pd name = convert name.sp|fc to dvi
    Spirit -p8 name = 8pt draft dvi
    Spirit -pb name = 8pt draft print-block dvi
    Spirit -pa name = if dvi, print all pages
    Spirit -p2 name = if dvi, print all pages, odd out and even back
    Spirit -pp name n,m,r-s = if dvi, print selected pages
  Convert
    Spirit -ch name = converts name to html
    Spirit -ct name = converts name to text
  Clean-up
    Spirit -x = clean up all temporary files

!Archive

Archive commands keep the last five versions of your work in
$HOME/archive/name where name is your filename.  Like if you
were writing Angel.sp, you could enter 
|
Spirit -az Angel
|
and it would zip every Angel file (*Angel*) into a numbered zipfile.
You can be lazy after that and use
|
Spirit -az An
|
if no other filenames use "An" in them. 

To use the FTP thingy and send or retrieve from a remote server, you
need a file called "$HOME/.spiritrc" on posix or "$HOME/spiritrc" on
lesser OSes.  It should read like:
<pre>
192.168.56.14 archive 4l3x4ndr14
</pre>
That's: name_or_IP_address user password.  And IP numbers resolve quicker
on Python so I use them.

!Conversion

Spirit will convert your fc or sp to HTML or text, leaving the files in
/tmp/spirit on a normal system or $HOME/spirit/tmp on the unfortunate
ones.

!Printing

This is a two step thingy.  First you need a dvi.  Screenplays only use
-pd. (You can try the others and learn why.) Fiction can use the eight
point ones and save mucho papel.  The print block option goes from a line
with 
\# PRINT BLOCK BEGIN
\to a line with 
\# PRINT BLOCK END

Part two sends the dvi file to the printer and the commands explain
themselves.
