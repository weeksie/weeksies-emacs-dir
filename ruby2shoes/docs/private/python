I love snakes

I used to have a pet python.  One day it ate my neighbor's fancy cat and
the first chance my neighbor got he shot my snake.  My kitchen table
still has the bullet in it.  When I showed the table and my dead snake
to Rudi Vasquez he told me he would personally shoot my neighbor (with
ratshot). But I said, No --because guns never stop till you're dead.  So
Rudi said, Okay, and we pulled out my neighbor's tire-stems with Rudi's
channel-locks instead.
