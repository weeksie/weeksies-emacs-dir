I got another snake story.  Me and rudy Vasquez were out along the
barbwire fence, waiting to pick up the kids after school.  We were just
talking about how fat the gringos in WalMart were getting to be, and
kind a dancing to that new Ha-Ash song (which you city girls should
check out) when we saw this turkey vulture circling down and down onto
the road.  He landed right next to a dead blue snake, gave it one of
both eyeballs, and then shook it in his beak.  Except the snake was a
broken plastic clothes hanger and the bird took off after telling us it
wasn't nothing for us to be laughing about.
