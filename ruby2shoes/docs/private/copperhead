Hey.  Another snake story.  I went out the other day to change the dog's
water and there was a copperhead on the stoop. (That's a porch, for you
city girls.) Copperheads are the prettiest snakes and they only strike
about eight inches, so they're not scary like those rattlers, who think
they can fly.  Anyway, this one was all rolled up and stupid because the
morning was so cool.  I poked a piece of plywood under him and he kind
of rolled over and licked his lips. But he couldn't think straight
enough to wake up.  So I walked him over to the leach field (and no, we
don't grow no leaches here but the dewberries are good) and tossed him
into the dewberry brambles.  He stretched out and blinked (if you can
call it that) and asked me if it was Easter yet.  I said it wasn't and
could I go now or would he like some breakfast?  And he said no, he'd
just wait right there for the bunny to bring him his eggs.  (Most of
this story is true.)
