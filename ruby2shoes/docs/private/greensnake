I don't know what these green snakes are called.  They're about two
inches thick, five feet long, and when your pit bull bites them in half
you get white goo all over your clothes.  There's a big one living in
the broken septic tank down by the Cantu's right now but Gus found his
in the mesquite meadow.  Gus was a bouncer.  Bounce.  Bounce.
Shakey-shakey and snakes came apart in two pieces.  Gus would eat half
and Jyp would run off with the other, even though he didn't care for raw
snake.  And I refused to cook it.  Does anyone know what the white stuff
is?  Pedro says "snake milk"; but the last time Pedro was right about
anything, I think Pancho Villa was still alive.
