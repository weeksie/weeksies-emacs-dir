!ruby2shoes and CafePress

@http://cafepress.com CafePress
is a site that let's you self-publish all kinds of books and create all kinds
of other merchandise which is printed on demand.  Check it out!  (Oh, and ruby2shoes
is not connected in any way to CafePress. Just so you know.)

!CafePress 5x8 Paperbacks

ruby2shoes does let you convert a ruby2shoes fiction file into the PDF
file CafePress can use to publish a 5x8 inch paperback of your work.
For an example of this, see:

The pieces to do this are:
+
Spirit - Just use the -cp switch on the commandline to create the PDF
header.paperback - it's in the user directory and needs to go in your spirit/user dir
paperback.cls - put it with the other LaTeX classes and run texhash to let TeX know it's there
BedOfAshes.fc - in user/examples, this is the start of one of my fc files to show you the frontmatter stuff
+

!Other CafePress Formats

Hey, there's just one of me and I'm working on it.  Go have a Tecate and chill.

!Other Necessary Things

You have to have a Unix environment.  Which you have if you're on Mac or
Linux or any other no-Bill OS.  If you're on Bill, you need the cygwin
stuff.  If this makes you nervous, relax.  Ask a geek. Then just let him
do it.  They want to anyway.

You have to have LaTeX and Python like you do with all ruby2shoes stuff.
And you have to have "dvips" which converts the LaTeX dvi result to
PostScript.  Last thing, you need "ps2pdf" -- guess why.  These are all
normal Unix things and can be had for free.
