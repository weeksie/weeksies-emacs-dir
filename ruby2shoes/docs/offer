!That's right -- FREE!

Maybe all you can handle, software-wise, is writing your
screenplay.  Maybe figuring out LaTeX and stuff is too much.

Okay.  I can help.  You send me your screenplay.  I'll turn it into a
pdf and send it back.  That way you can print it on anything that has
Adobe Acrobat on it.  You can get that for free no matter what you are
on.

Here's the deal:
+
Your screenplay has to be in ruby2shoes .sp format 
It can't be bigger than 256kb (256,000 bytes)
Attach it to an email
Send it to dos_zapatas@yahoo.com
I'll convert it and send it right back.

What's .sp format?  It's just a text file created in Emacs using
my Emacs modes.  You can read on the other pages how to install them
in Emacs and you can get Emacs for free, even for Windows.
In the Emacs Help menu is a tutorial.  So hey, figure out that much
and you're home free.


If enough peopla are interested, I'll figure out how to automate the 
pdf creation and do it on the Net.
