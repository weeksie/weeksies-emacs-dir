!Spirit

First, you've got to install Spirit.  It's a Python package and you
unpack it with "tar" or "WinZip" or whatever.  This gives you a
directory called ruby2shoes-DDMMMYY.  Go in there and install it.

Here's the generic instructions for installing Python packages.
|
To install the package, run the following command:

						python setup.py install

Alternatively, copy the whole ruby2shoes directory into your Python path
(eg. unix: /usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages, Windows: C:\PythonXY,
or C:\PythonXY\Lib\site-packages).  That's all that setup.py does.  Only
copy the ruby2shoes directory that's inside the distributed
tarball/zip-archive, not the entire ruby2shoes-x.x.x directory!
|
The executable file is "Spirit" in the user directory.  Put this
anywhere on your path.  This means, somewhere that typing "Spirit" in a
terminal will run the thing.  

Then make a directory called "spirit" in your $HOME directory and copy
or move the user directory from the package in there so you have
/home/you/spirit/user or C:/spirit/user or whatever works on your OS.

!Emacs Modes 

In the user directory, is the emacs_modes directory and in there are
screenplay.el and fiction.el.  Emacs uses a start-up file in your $HOME
directory called ".emacs" or "emacs".  ruby2shoes needs these lines in
that file:

|
<pre>
;;  screenplay-mode
(load "/home/you/spirit/user/emacs_modes/screenplay")
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (cons '("\\.sp" . screenplay-mode) auto-mode-alist))
;; fiction-mode
(load "/home/you/spirit/user/emacs_modes/fiction")
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (cons '("\\.fc" . fiction-mode) auto-mode-alist))
</pre>
|

Open or create some.fc or some.sp file and you will automatically start up
Ruby's modes.  Type "C-h m" or "Control-h" then "m" and you will get Ruby's
mode help.

!LaTeX Classes

Here's the tricky part.  To print ruby2shoes files, you have to use the
LaTeX classes in user/latex_classes.  And to do that, LaTeX has to know
where they are.  And where to put them is system-dependent.  On my Linux
box, they are in /usr/share/texmf-local. On any system, there is a file
called texmf.cnf that tells where LaTeX looks for classes.  Mine is
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf.  After you put the classes where they
should be, run "texhash" at a terminal.  If you are lucky, you won't
have permission to run texhash and your admin can install the files and
run it for you.

!The Other Stuff

Leave the other stuff in the $HOME/spirit/user directory.  Spirit
expects to find the header files there and you might end up using the
other stuff after you get some things written.
